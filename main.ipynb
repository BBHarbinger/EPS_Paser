    "In the context of financial analysis, accurately extracting Earnings Per Share (EPS) data from regulatory filings is essential for investors, analysts, and financial professionals. This task, often complicated by the diverse formats and structures of financial documents, requires a robust and adaptable parsing solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involves developing a parser to extract EPS data from SEC EDGAR filings in HTML format, as part of an assessment for a DevOps Engineer Interview at Trexquant Investment LP. The primary objective is to create a versatile parser that can handle various filing formats, systematically extract the latest quarterly EPS for each company, and present this data in a structured CSV format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The development and testing of this parser are grounded in the analysis of 50 provided HTML files, focusing on identifying common patterns, handling variations, and ensuring the parser's adaptability to unseen document formats. The outcome of this project will be a reliable tool capable of facilitating informed financial decision-making through accurate data extraction."

    "To build a robust parser, we will meticulously analyze the 50 training filings, identifying the common patterns and locations where EPS data is typically reported. This analysis will encompass recognizing keywords, table structures, and contextual cues that signal the presence of relevant information. We will also pay close attention to potential inconsistencies and edge cases, ensuring our parser's accuracy and adaptability across different EDGAR filings."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Core Tags (`table`, `td`, `tr`)**:\n",
    "   - **High Occurrence (100%)**: Tags like `<table>`, `<td>`, `<tr>`, and related tags appear in every document. This indicates that EPS data, which is typically presented in tabular format, is consistently structured within tables. Therefore, the parser should primarily focus on searching within `<table>` tags to locate EPS values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Document Structure (`html`, `body`, `title`)**:\n",
    "   - **High Occurrence (100%)**: Tags such as `<html>`, `<body>`, and `<title>` are present in every file, indicating that all documents follow a well-defined HTML structure. The `<title>` tag, which often contains the document's title, might give context (e.g., the company name or report type) that could help identify relevant sections of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Financial Data Tags (`sup`, `sub`)**:\n",
    "   - **Moderate Occurrence (76%, 84%)**: Tags like `<sup>` (often used for superscripts like footnotes) might be associated with small notations beside financial data, including EPS figures. These tags are important for handling any associated footnotes or references that could alter the interpretation of the EPS data (e.g., adjustments for extraordinary items).\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Formatting Tags (`font`, `br`, `hr`, `b`)**:\n",
    "   - **High to Moderate Occurrence**: Tags like `<font>`, `<br>`, and `<b>` indicate that the documents use various formatting styles to highlight or structure the data. Bold tags (`<b>`) often emphasize key financial metrics, including EPS."

    "#### High-Level Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Isolate Relevant Sections**:\n",
    "   - **Goal**: Focus on parts of the document that are likely to contain EPS-related information, primarily the tables.\n",
    "   - **Method**: Extract all `<table>` elements from each HTML file since these sections are structured and likely contain financial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tokenize Content**:\n",
    "   - **Goal**: Break down the table content into manageable pieces (tokens) to identify relevant information.\n",
    "   - **Method**: Treat each cell within a table (`<td>` or `<th>`) as a token. These tokens will contain words or phrases that can be analyzed individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pattern Matching**:\n",
    "   - **Goal**: Identify tokens that are likely to be related to EPS by searching for specific keywords or phrases.\n",
    "   - **Method**: Look for the presence of certain key components within each token, such as:\n",
    "     - **\"earn\"**: Captures \"earnings,\" \"earn,\" \"earning,\" etc.\n",
    "     - **\"per\"**: Relevant for identifying \"per share.\"\n",
    "     - **\"share\"**: Specifically targets mentions of shares.\n",
    "     - **\"loss\"**: Captures contexts like \"net income (loss)\" or \"earnings (loss) per share.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Contextual Analysis**:\n",
    "   - **Goal**: Ensure the identified tokens are relevant to EPS and not unrelated financial terms (like \"expenses\").\n",
    "   - **Method**: Consider the context in which these tokens appear. This involves checking the neighboring tokens or phrases to confirm they relate to EPS (e.g., \"net income (loss)\" or \"GAAP earnings per share\").\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Extraction and Aggregation**:\n",
    "   - **Goal**: Extract the relevant phrases or terms and aggregate them across all documents.\n",
    "   - **Method**: Combine tokens that are identified as related to EPS into complete phrases, and track their occurrences across all files.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Generalization**:\n",
    "   - **Goal**: Develop a robust approach that can handle variations in how EPS is presented across different documents.\n",
    "   - **Method**: Use the patterns identified to create generalized rules that can be applied to other datasets.\n",

    "2. **Coverage Across Files**:\n",
    "   - The extraction process successfully spanned a wide range of files, demonstrating that the filtering criteria were broad enough to capture relevant phrases from various sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inclusion of Irrelevant Phrases**:\n",
    "   - Despite the filtering, many phrases that are not directly relevant to EPS calculations remain in the results. For instance, phrases like \"shares used in diluted per share calculations\" may not provide the precise EPS values we aim to extract.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Over-Inclusiveness**:\n",
    "   - The broad criteria used for filtering allowed for the capture of a wide array of phrases, some of which may not directly relate to EPS figures but instead to peripheral information such as share counts or reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ambiguity in Some Terms**:\n",
    "   - Certain phrases, while containing key terms like \"earnings\" or \"share,\" may refer to different financial metrics or calculations that are not relevant to the core EPS value we seek. This introduces ambiguity and can dilute the effectiveness of the filtering process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Complexity in Non-GAAP Reporting**:\n",
    "   - The presence of non-GAAP terms like \"adjusted EPS\" or \"economic EPS\" adds complexity, as these metrics may vary significantly across filings and may not always align with standard EPS calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given these limitations, the next step involves a more structured approach to extracting relevant EPS data by analyzing the HTML file's underlying data structure.**\n"

    "##### Observations:\n",
    "1. **Misalignment of Data:**\n",
    "   - The table appears to have many \"NaN\" values, which suggests that the columns are not properly aligned with the corresponding headers.\n",
    "   - For example, in rows that should contain financial data, such as \"GAAP Net income per share - diluted,\" the values are spread across multiple columns, leading to confusion and loss of information clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Merged or Spanned Cells:**\n",
    "   - The original HTML table might have used `colspan` or `rowspan` attributes to merge cells, which can cause issues when converting the HTML table directly into a DataFrame. These merged cells can lead to misaligned columns if not handled correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Repetitive Headers:**\n",
    "   - The presence of repeated headers like \"Three Months Ended March 31,\" across multiple columns could indicate that the data was intended to be grouped but has been split incorrectly across columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Non-Numeric Data in Numeric Columns:**\n",
    "   - Cells intended for numeric values often contain text descriptions (e.g., \"(in millions, except per share amounts)\"), which can disrupt the alignment and proper interpretation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Implications:\n",
    "- **Manual Adjustment Required:** Automatic table extraction may require significant manual intervention to correct misalignments and properly organize the data into coherent columns.\n",
    "- **Challenges with Automated Tools:** The complexity of the table's original formatting, especially with merged cells and non-standard structures, poses challenges for automated extraction tools, which are often not equipped to handle these issues without additional logic.\n",
